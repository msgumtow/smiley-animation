/**
 * PART 2:
 * 
 * Now you'll code the four LEDs that are different to switch back and forth, using "toggle" blocks.
 * 
 * Determine the blocks on the smiley and non smiley that are DIFFERENT from each one and plot each one in a toggle block.
 * 
 * Put a "pause" block between the first two toggles and the last two toggles.
 */
/**
 * PART 1:
 * 
 * Plot the coordinates of only the LEDs that are the SAME in both the smiley and straight faced images.
 * 
 * <---Use these as only a reference - do not put them in "on start"
 * 
 * Use these plot blocks to plot the coordinates -->
 * 
 * Put each plot block in "on start" one by one to see if it's in the right place. I did the first one for you.
